# Module-14-Belly-Button-Challenge
files for Data Boot Camp Module 14 Data Collection Challege

## Challenge Overview 
In this challenge I built an interactive dashboard to display Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). This dataset catalogs microbes that colonize human navels, and through the creation of a dashboard using Javascript, users can select any id number of a sample from the dataset and view the top ten OTUs (operational taxonomic units = the small handful of microbial species) present in that individual sample. Users can engage with the following visualizations: 

1. hbar

2. Bubble chart

3. Demographics panel 

4. Washing guage?
