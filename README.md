# Module-14-Belly-Button-Challenge
files for Data Boot Camp Module 14 Data Collection Challege

## Challenge Overview 
In this challenge I built an interactive dashboard to display the **Belly Button Biodiversity** dataset (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/). This dataset catalogs microbes (called operational toxonomic units, or OTUs) that colonize human navels, and through a dashboard created using Javascript, users can select any sample from the dataset and view the following visualizations: 

1. A bar chart depicting the top ten OTUs in the selected sample 

2. A bubble chart depicting the concentration of individual OTUs present in a selected sample 

3. A panel with demographic information associated with a selected sample
